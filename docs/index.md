# Welcome to Moshthesubnet 🎸💻

I'm a Network Support Specialist and IT professional based in UT. I specialize in bridging the gap between complex infrastructure and efficient automation. This site serves as a live documentation of my homelab, my career journey, and my ongoing projects in networking and Python.

## 🚀 About Me
After spending the majority of my professional career working in the medical industry, I pivoted to Network Engineering, where I manage infrastructure for government-contracted projects. I'm a firm believer in the "Lab Everything" philosophy-if I’m not configuring it at work, I’m probably breaking it (and fixing it) in my Proxmox cluster at home.

When I'm not in the terminal, you can find me at a punk rock show or tinkering with my automation workflows.
