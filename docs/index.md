# Welcome to Mosh The Subnet 🎸🤘

I'm **Skyler King**—a Network Support Specialist, homelab enthusiast, and emo/punk rock fan.

I document my journey from "it works on my machine" to enterprise-grade network engineering here. Whether it's breaking OSPF in the lab or fixing critical infrastructure in production, this is where I write it down.
