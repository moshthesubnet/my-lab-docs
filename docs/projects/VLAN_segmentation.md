# VLAN Segmentation Project

## Project Overview

This project documents the redesign and implementation of network segmentation using VLANs to improve security, management, and network isolation in my homelab environment.

## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated from a basic VLAN configuration using the insecure default VLAN 1 for LAN traffic to a properly segmented network with a secure native VLAN and dedicated management VLAN. This implementation follows industry best practices for network security and segmentation.

## Network Architecture Evolution

### Before: Initial Topology

The original network configuration had several security concerns:

| VLAN ID | Name | Network Subnet | Purpose |
|---------|------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | LAN | 10.30.X.0/24 | General LAN traffic (Default VLAN) |
| 20 | MALWARE | 10.0.X.0/24 | Malware analysis environment |
| 30 | HOMELAB | 10.30.X.0/24 | Lab testing environment |
| 40 | SERVERS | 10.30.X.0/28 | Production servers |
| 50 | IoT | 10.30.X.0/24 | Internet of Things devices |

**Key Issues Identified:**

- Using VLAN 1 as the native VLAN (security vulnerability)
- VLAN 1 carrying user traffic (against best practices)
- No dedicated management VLAN for network device administration
- Potential for VLAN hopping attacks

### After: Improved Topology

The redesigned network architecture addresses security concerns and implements proper segmentation:

| VLAN ID | Name | Network Subnet | Purpose |
|---------|------|----------------|---------|
| 999 | Native | N/A | Native VLAN (no IP addressing) |
| 10 | Home | 10.10.X.0/24 | General home network traffic |
| 20 | MALWARE | 10.0.X.0/24 | Isolated malware analysis |
| 30 | HOMELAB | 10.30.X.0/24 | Lab and testing environment |
| 40 | SERVERS | 10.30.X.0/28 | Production server subnet |
| 50 | IoT | 10.30.X.0/24 | IoT device isolation |
| 99 | MGMT | 10.0.X.0/24 | Network management |

**Improvements Implemented:**

- Native VLAN changed to 999 (no IP addressing for security)
- Dedicated management VLAN (99) for switch/router administration
- VLAN 1 completely removed from production use
- Maintained existing segmentation for malware, homelab, servers, and IoT
- Renamed general LAN to "Home" with new subnet for clarity

## Technical Implementation

### Design Decisions

#### 1. Native VLAN Security (VLAN 999)

**Rationale:**

The native VLAN carries untagged traffic on trunk ports. Using VLAN 1 as the native VLAN is a well-known security risk because:

- VLAN 1 cannot be deleted from Cisco switches
- Certain control plane traffic defaults to VLAN 1
- It's the first VLAN attackers target for VLAN hopping attacks

**Implementation:**

- Changed native VLAN to 999 across all trunk links
- VLAN 999 has no IP addressing or user traffic
- Prevents unauthorized access through untagged frames

#### 2. Management VLAN (VLAN 99)

**Rationale:**

Separating management traffic from user data provides:

- Enhanced security through network isolation
- Easier access control and monitoring
- Protection of administrative interfaces
- Simplified troubleshooting

**Implementation:**

- Created VLAN 99 with subnet 10.0.X.0/24
- Assigned all switch and router management interfaces to this VLAN
- Implemented access control lists (ACLs) restricting management access
- Enabled SSH only on VLAN 99 interface

#### 3. Network Segmentation Strategy

**VLAN 10 - Home Network (10.10.X.0/24):**

- General user traffic for trusted home devices
- Workstations, laptops, phones
- Access to internet and select server resources

**VLAN 20 - MALWARE Analysis (10.0.X.0/24):**

- Heavily isolated environment for malware analysis
- No outbound internet access
- Firewall rules block all inter-VLAN communication
- Snapshot/rollback capabilities for VMs

**VLAN 30 - HOMELAB (10.30.X.0/24):**

- Testing and development environment
- Isolated from production servers
- Can be reset without impacting production

**VLAN 40 - SERVERS (10.30.X.0/28):**

- Production server subnet (/28 = 14 usable hosts)
- Smaller subnet reflects current server needs
- Controlled access from other VLANs via firewall rules
- Hosts critical services (DNS, DHCP, file servers, etc.)

**VLAN 50 - IoT (10.30.X.0/24):**

- Isolated smart home and IoT devices
- No direct access to servers or home network
- Internet access only (restricted outbound)
- Prevents IoT devices from becoming pivot points

### Configuration Examples

#### Switch Configuration (Trunk Port)
```
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 description Trunk to Core Router
 switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport trunk native vlan 999
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30,40,50,99
 no shutdown
```

#### Switch Configuration (Access Port - Home VLAN)
```
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 description Home Network Access Port
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
 switchport port-security
 switchport port-security maximum 2
 spanning-tree portfast
 no shutdown
```

#### 2. Management Access Control

- Management VLAN (99) isolated from user VLANs
- SSH access only (Telnet disabled)
- ACLs restricting management access to specific IP addresses
- Strong passwords and AAA authentication

#### 3. Inter-VLAN Routing Controls

- Firewall rules control traffic between VLANs
- Default deny policy with explicit allow rules
- MALWARE VLAN has no access to other networks
- IoT VLAN restricted to internet only

#### 4. Port Security

- Violation actions configured (shutdown)


### Firewall Rules Summary

**Home VLAN (10) can access:**

- Internet (all protocols)

## Lessons Learned

### Challenges Encountered

#### 1. Native VLAN Mismatch Issues

- Initial misconfiguration caused trunk links to fail
- **Solution:** Verified native VLAN configuration on both ends of trunks
- Used `show interfaces trunk` to confirm consistency

#### 2. Voice VLAN Consideration

- Initially forgot to plan for future VoIP deployment
- **Solution:** Reserved VLAN 60 for future voice traffic

#### 3. Management Access Lockout Risk

- Changing management VLAN could cause lockout
- **Solution:** Maintained console cable access during changes
- Configured rollback timer on switches

#### 4. DHCP Relay Configuration

- Devices in VLANs not receiving IP addresses
- **Solution:** Configured `ip helper-address` on router subinterfaces pointing to DHCP server

### Best Practices Applied

- Never use VLAN 1 for user traffic
- Change native VLAN to unused VLAN ID (999)
- Create dedicated management VLAN
- Explicitly configure trunk allowed VLANs
- Document all VLAN assignments and IP schemes
- Implement port security on access ports
- Use descriptive VLAN names and interface descriptions
- Test changes in lab environment first (VLAN 30)
- Maintain network diagrams and IP address documentation
