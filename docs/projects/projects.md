## Network Infrastructure Projects

### [Privacy-First Local AI Coding Assistant](./Local_AI_Coding_Agent.md)

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Date:** February 2026

Deployed a fully localized, privacy-first AI coding assistant for secure, terminal-based pair programming. This setup utilizes an open-weight model hosted on a Proxmox VM to assist with developing Python automation scripts for network engineering labs without exposing code to third-party APIs.

**Key Highlights:**

- Deployed Ollama on an Ubuntu Server virtual machine
- Hosted the Qwen2.5-Coder:14B model locally
- Integrated Aider on the local workstation for seamless terminal access
- Focused on security by utilizing a scoped coding tool rather than OS-level agents (e.g., OpenClaw)
- Automated Python scripting workflows for CCNA lab scenarios

**Technologies:** Proxmox, Ubuntu Server, Ollama, Qwen2.5-Coder, Aider, Python, Generative AI

### [VLAN Segmentation and Security Hardening](./VLAN_segmentation.md)

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Date:** January 2026

Comprehensive network redesign implementing proper VLAN segmentation, security hardening, and management network isolation. Migrated from insecure default VLAN 1 configuration to industry best-practice architecture with dedicated management VLAN and secure native VLAN.

**Key Highlights:**

- Eliminated VLAN 1 security vulnerabilities
- Implemented secure native VLAN (999)
- Created dedicated management network (VLAN 99)
- Configured inter-VLAN routing and firewall rules
- Isolated malware analysis, homelab, servers, and IoT networks

**Technologies:** VLANs, 802.1Q, Inter-VLAN Routing, Access Control Lists, Network Segmentation
