# About & Accomplishments

## :material-card-account-details-outline: Who I Am

I am a Network Support Specialist and mid-career professional who successfully transitioned into IT from a non-technical background. My journey is defined by a relentless drive to learn—illustrated by my rapid acquisition of industry certifications and the complex, enterprise-grade homelab I maintain to sharpen my skills.

Currently, I am pursuing a **B.S. in Cloud and Network Engineering (Cisco)** at **Western Governors University**.

## 🏆 Professional Accomplishments

*From my recent work as an IT Intern & Network Support Specialist:*

### Production Environment

* **Critical Infrastructure Rescue:** Diagnosed and resolved a critical IPsec VPN tunnel failure affecting a production licensing server. This intervention restored connectivity, preventing 3+ hours of downtime and saving estimated operational costs of ~$15k.

* **Enterprise Network Segmentation:** Configured and implemented five secure VLANs to segment a flat Layer 2 network. This reduced broadcast traffic and security risks for 150+ devices while improving overall network performance by 30%.

* **Rapid Deployment:** Deployed full IT infrastructure for a newly acquired office—provisioning network connectivity, video conferencing systems, and 25 workstations to achieve full operational readiness within 48 hours.

### Homelab Projects

* **VLAN Security Hardening:** Redesigned my homelab network architecture from an insecure default configuration to a properly segmented, security-hardened topology following Cisco best practices. Eliminated VLAN 1 vulnerabilities, implemented secure native VLAN (999), and created dedicated management VLAN (99). Deployed 7-VLAN architecture with firewall rules isolating home, malware analysis, homelab, servers, IoT, and management traffic.<br>[View full documentation →](projects/VLAN_segmentation.md)

* **Proxmox Virtualization Cluster:** Built and maintain a multi-node Proxmox setup running 15+ VMs and LXC containers including Netbox, Pi-hole DNS, Docker hosts, and Ollama LLM servers.

* **Network Automation:** Developing Ansible playbooks for automated network device configuration, backup, and compliance checking across Cisco and Ubiquiti infrastructure.
