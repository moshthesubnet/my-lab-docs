# About & Accomplishments

## :material-card-account-details-outline: Who I Am
I am a Network Support Specialist and mid-career professional who successfully transitioned into IT from a non-technical background. My journey is defined by a relentless drive to learn—illustrated by my rapid acquisition of industry certifications and the complex, enterprise-grade homelab I maintain to sharpen my skills.

Currently, I am pursuing a **B.S. in Network Engineering and Security (Cisco Track)** at **Western Governors University**.

## 🏆 Professional Accomplishments
*From my recent work as an IT Intern & Network Support Specialist:*

* **Critical Infrastructure Rescue:** Diagnosed and resolved a critical IPsec VPN tunnel failure affecting a production licensing server. This intervention restored connectivity, preventing 3+ hours of downtime and saving estimated operational costs of ~$15k.
* **Network Segmentation:** Configured and implemented five secure VLANs to segment a flat Layer 2 network. This reduced broadcast traffic and security risks for 150+ devices while improving overall network performance by 30%.
* **Rapid Deployment:** Deployed full IT infrastructure for a newly acquired office—provisioning network connectivity, video conferencing systems, and 25 workstations to achieve full operational readiness within 48 hours.
