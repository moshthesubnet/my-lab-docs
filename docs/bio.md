# ⚡ The Person Behind the Pit

I’m a Network Engineering student, a career changer, and a lifelong fan of the punk rock/emo DIY ethic. Based in Utah, I’ve spent the last few years transitioning from the medical industry.

## 🎸 The Story
My path into IT wasn't a straight line. I started my professional pivot in my mid-30s, proving that it’s never too late to reinvent yourself in tech. I began with the foundational "grind" of help desk/IT intern, which gave me a deep appreciation for the end-user experience. 

In late 2025, I made the jump into my first network role as a Network Support Specialist. Today, I balance my professional responsibilities with a relentless pursuit of networking knowledge—specifically focusing on OSPF, VLAN segmentation, and automation. After I graduate, I also plan on pursuing the CCNP certification.

## 📸 Content Creation
Under the handle **@moshthesubnet**, I create tech and networking content for Instagram and maybe TikTok/Youtube in the future. My goal is to demystify complex networking topics—like IP subnetting—for the next generation of IT professionals and career changers. I believe the IT community is at its best when we share our "labs" and our lessons.
